## Frontend Roadmap

Short- and mid-term plan to evolve user experience, interface design, and policy management while maintaining intuitive and secure document processing workflows.

### User Interface Design
- **Modern UI Framework**: Use Tailwind CSS to re-write the UI for modern, responsive design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes with system preference detection.
- **Consistent Design System**: Establish design tokens, components, and patterns for cohesive user experience.

### Security Level Management
- **Policy Groups**: Implement three security level groups: Basic, Balanced, and Strict.
- **Entity Group Assignment**: Assign current entities into appropriate security level groups:
  - **Basic**: Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
  - **Balanced**: Basic entities + SSN, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, driver's license numbers
  - **Strict**: All entities + credentials/secrets, crypto wallets, device IDs, health information, legal data
- **Security Level Tab**: Dedicated interface for users to select their preferred security level.
- **Dynamic Entity Lists**: Show/hide entities based on selected security level.
- **Level Descriptions**: Clear explanations of what each security level protects against.

### Expert Configuration
- **Expert Option Tab**: Advanced interface for power users to customize entity detection and masking.
- **Per-Entity Controls**: Individual toggles for each entity type with confidence threshold sliders.
- **Custom Policy Editor**: Allow users to create and modify custom masking templates.
- **Entity-Specific Actions**: Choose between remove, pseudonymize, format-preserving, or placeholder for each entity.
- **Template Management**: Save, load, and share custom policy templates.

### Policy Management Interface
- **Remove "Mask All" Options**: Eliminate blanket masking options to encourage thoughtful policy selection.
- **Per-Entity Action Selector**: Interface for choosing remove | pseudonymize | format-preserving | placeholder actions.
- **Template Editor**: Visual editor for creating custom masking templates with preview functionality.
- **Policy Presets**: Quick-select buttons for common use cases (GDPR, HIPAA, COPPA compliance).
- **Policy Validation**: Real-time validation of policy configurations with helpful error messages.

### Detection and Preview
- **Detection Preview**: Highlight detected entities per page before committing redaction.
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual confidence scores for each detected entity.
- **Preview with Masked Tokens**: Show final masked tokens/pseudonyms (not just redaction boxes) for verification.
- **Entity Statistics**: Display counts and types of detected entities before processing.
- **False Positive Handling**: Easy-to-use interface for marking false positives and adjusting thresholds.

### Progress and Status
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator for document processing with detailed status messages.
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates on processing status, current page, and estimated completion time.
- **Processing Queue**: Interface for managing multiple document processing jobs.
- **Status Notifications**: Toast notifications for processing completion, errors, and warnings.
- **Cancel/Resume**: Ability to cancel or pause long-running processing jobs.

### File Management
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive file upload with visual feedback.
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple documents simultaneously.
- **File Format Support**: Clear indicators for supported file types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV, RTF, Markdown).
- **File Validation**: Pre-processing validation with helpful error messages for unsupported or corrupted files.
- **Processing History**: Track and manage previously processed documents.

### Export and Reporting
- **Dry-run Report Export**: Export detected entities as JSON/CSV for audit purposes.
- **Processing Reports**: Generate detailed reports of what was detected and masked.
- **Mapping Export**: Optional export of per-document entity-mask mappings (encrypted) for audit/reversibility.
- **Compliance Reports**: Generate reports tailored for specific regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- **Custom Report Templates**: Allow users to create and save custom report formats.

### Settings and Configuration
- **User Preferences**: Persistent settings for default policies, UI preferences, and processing options.
- **Key Management**: Interface for managing encryption keys and security settings.
- **Model Management**: Optional UI for managing NER models and cache.
- **Language Settings**: Interface for selecting processing language and regional settings.
- **Advanced Settings**: Collapsible section for power user configurations.

### Help and Documentation
- **Contextual Help**: Tooltips and help text throughout the interface.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Guided tours for new users and feature introductions.
- **Policy Guidance**: Built-in help for understanding different entity types and masking options.
- **Video Tutorials**: Embedded video guides for common workflows.
- **FAQ Section**: Frequently asked questions with searchable answers.

### Performance and Responsiveness
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback for user actions while processing occurs in background.
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient loading of large documents and processing results.
- **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching of user preferences, policies, and processing results.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly error messages and recovery options.
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline functionality for viewing previously processed documents.

### Accessibility and Usability
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interface elements.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Support for high contrast themes and text scaling.
- **Multi-language Support**: Interface localization for multiple languages.
- **User Testing**: Regular usability testing and feedback incorporation.

### Integration Features
- **API Integration**: Interface for connecting with external systems and APIs.
- **Workflow Automation**: Tools for integrating DocuSafely into existing document workflows.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Optional integration with cloud storage providers.
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced features for enterprise deployments and team management.
