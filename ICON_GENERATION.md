# Icon Generation Guide

## Generated Icons

All required icon formats have been successfully generated from the source `build/icon.png`:

### Files Created
- ✅ **build/icon.png** (1024x1024) - Used for macOS and Linux builds
- ✅ **build/icon.ico** - Multi-resolution Windows icon containing:
  - 16x16
  - 32x32
  - 48x48
  - 64x64
  - 128x128
  - 256x256

## Build Configuration

The `package.json` is properly configured with icon paths:

```json
"build": {
  "icon": "build/icon.png",  // Default for macOS/Linux
  "win": {
    "icon": "build/icon.ico"  // Windows-specific
  }
}
```

## Verification

Both macOS and Windows builds have been tested and completed successfully:

### macOS Build ✅
```bash
npm run build:mac
```
- Creates DMG and ZIP distributions
- Icon properly embedded in .app bundle

### Windows Build ✅
```bash
npx electron-builder --win --dir
```
- Icon properly embedded in .exe
- All size variants included in ICO file

## Regenerating Icons

If you need to update the icon in the future:

1. Replace `build/icon.png` with your new icon (should be square, preferably 512x512 or larger)
2. Run the generation script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate-icons.py
   ```
3. This will regenerate `build/icon.ico` with all required sizes

## Icon Script

The `scripts/generate-icons.py` utility:
- Reads `build/icon.png` as source
- Generates Windows ICO with multiple embedded sizes (16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256)
- Validates that source PNG is at least 512x512
- Can be run anytime to regenerate icons after updating the source

## Current Icon

The current icon features a geometric 3D shape logo with:
- Blue background (#4A6FA5 approximately)
- White geometric symbol
- Rounded corners (suitable for modern OS styles)
- 1024x1024 resolution
- RGBA format with transparency support
